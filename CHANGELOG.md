Added:
- `Report Bugs` and `Changelog` buttons to `Settings > About`
- Markdown parsing for settings descriptions

Fixed:
- Fonts looking blurry
- Notification popups are now visible when the (dribbblish) settings are open
- Missing settings for on/off times for `Based on Time` dark mode (#107)

Improved:
- Settings that have been changed from default will now show a line next to them. Inspired by the [Visual Studio Code settings UI](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d1f1ea4def506997ced23d3d912154794e530e1c/063d2/assets/img/blog/2020-09-17-vscode-settings/settings-ui.png)
- Checkbox / Switch input styles are now more in line with other input styles
