Add:
- New settings area called "Consistency" for things that make it more consistent with the original spotify theme
- Ability to hide album name and year in playbar (#85)

Fix:
- Some sidebar items hawing wrong width on hover [(see)](https://github.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme/issues/87#issuecomment-954305428)
- Sidebar config buttons being below the text
- Fix #87 by not showing the playing indicator above "Liked Songs"
